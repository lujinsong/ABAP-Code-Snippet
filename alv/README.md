# How to rapidly develop an ALV report :)
## The best way to rapidly develop an ALV report is to use the design pattern and create template program as the starting point to reuse the existing code. It not only speeds up the development but also simplifies the maintenance.

## Step one. Please follow CREATE_ALV_Tempate_Program.pdf file to create a template ALV program. This is your starting point for future rapid ALV development. The template file is Z_ALV_TEMPLATE_LOCALCLASS.txt.
