The ZMG_INCLUDE file includes the forms and abap class to convert internal table to an excel output based on the mapping template file.
The mapping template file includes three rows. The first row is the export file's header column names. The second row contains the internal table's field name.
The third row contains the default value if no mapping is specified, usually is the set up data.

The output file in the server mode is a tab deliminator text file. You may open it in excel to do the conversion. If no date format conversion, in the last step, please choose text.
